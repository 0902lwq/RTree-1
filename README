R-TREES: A DYNAMIC INDEX STRUCTURE FOR SPATIAL SEARCHING
--------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION

    A C++ templated version of the RTree algorithm.
    The code it now generally compatible with the STL and Boost C++ libraries.
    For more information please read the comments in RTree.h

    idea is to keep it as public domain as possible while not "public

FILES

    - RTree.h            The C++ templated RTree implementation. Well commented.
    - Test.cpp           A simple test program, ported from the original C version.
    - MemoryTest.cpp     A more rigourous test to validate memory use.
    - README             This file.

TO BUILD

    To build a test, compile only one of the test files with RTree.h.  
    Both test files contain a main() function.
